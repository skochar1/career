# Scalability Architecture & Performance Considerations

## Overview
This backend is designed to scale from hundreds to millions of jobs while maintaining performance and responsiveness.

## Core Architecture

### Database Layer (`lib/database.ts`)
- **SQLite for Development**: Fast local development with automatic schema setup
- **PostgreSQL for Production**: Configured for high-volume operations
- **Optimized Indexes**: Strategic indexing on frequently queried fields (active jobs, seniority, location, candidate sessions, match scores)
- **Database Connection Management**: Persistent connections with WAL mode for better concurrent reads

### Caching Layer (`lib/cache.ts`)
- **In-Memory LRU Cache**: Fast response times for frequently accessed data
- **Intelligent Cache Keys**: Structured keys based on query parameters
- **TTL Management**: 2-minute TTL for job listings, configurable per use case
- **Cache Invalidation**: Pattern-based invalidation when job data changes
- **Memory Management**: Automatic eviction of oldest entries when capacity reached

### Search Engine (`lib/search.ts`)
- **Full-Text Search Index**: In-memory inverted index for fast job searching
- **Multi-Level Scoring**: Exact matches (3pts), prefix matches (2pts), partial matches (1pt)
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic index updates when jobs are added/removed
- **Filtering Support**: Location, seniority, department, and remote work filters

## Scalability Analysis

### 500 Jobs
- **Current Solution**: Handles easily with sub-10ms response times
- **Memory Usage**: ~1MB for search index, ~500KB for cache
- **Database**: SQLite sufficient, single-server deployment

### 5,000 Jobs
- **Performance**: Still excellent with current architecture
- **Memory Usage**: ~10MB for search index, ~5MB for cache
- **Optimizations**: Cache hit rates improve due to more repeated queries
- **Database**: SQLite still viable, PostgreSQL recommended for production

### 500,000 Jobs
- **Critical Changes Needed**:
  - **Database Sharding**: Partition jobs by location/industry
  - **Distributed Cache**: Redis cluster replaces in-memory cache
  - **Search Optimization**: Index compression and lazy loading
  - **API Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse with exponential backoff
- **Memory Management**: 
  - Paginated search index loading (~100MB total)
  - Cache size increase to 1GB with Redis
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with read replicas and connection pooling

### 5,000,000 Jobs
- **Infrastructure Requirements**:
  - **Microservices Architecture**: Separate job service, search service, matching service
  - **Elasticsearch Integration**: Replace custom search with distributed search engine
  - **CDN Implementation**: Cache static job data at edge locations
  - **Event-Driven Updates**: Async job updates via message queues
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - **Database Federation**: Distribute across multiple PostgreSQL instances
  - **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching (L1: In-memory, L2: Redis, L3: CDN)
  - **Search Index Clustering**: Distributed search across multiple nodes
  - **Background Processing**: Move matching calculations to async workers

## Key Performance Features

### Resume Processing
- **File Validation**: Size limits (5MB) and type restrictions (PDF/TXT)
- **Skill Extraction**: Pattern-matching algorithm with 40+ skill categories
- **Experience Detection**: Multi-criteria experience level classification
- **Match Scoring**: Real-time calculation with caching of results

### Job Matching Algorithm
- **Skills Matching**: Required skills (3x weight) vs preferred skills (1x weight)
- **Experience Alignment**: Prevents overqualified/underqualified matches
- **Score Normalization**: 0-100 scale for consistent ranking
- **Batch Processing**: Calculate matches for all active jobs efficiently

### API Performance
- **Pagination**: Configurable limits with 100-job maximum per request
- **Query Optimization**: Smart query building based on available filters
- **Response Compression**: JSON responses optimized for size
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with detailed error messages

## Trade-offs & Design Decisions

### Current Implementation
- **✅ Pros**: Simple deployment, fast development, excellent performance at medium scale
- **⚠️ Cons**: Single-point-of-failure, memory constraints at very high scale

### Future Scalability Path
1. **Phase 1** (5K-50K jobs): Add Redis, PostgreSQL, load balancing
2. **Phase 2** (50K-500K jobs): Implement read replicas, cache clusters, API rate limiting
3. **Phase 3** (500K+ jobs): Microservices, Elasticsearch, distributed architecture

## Monitoring & Observability
- **Cache Performance**: Hit/miss ratios, memory usage, eviction rates
- **Search Performance**: Query response times, index size, update frequency
- **Database Performance**: Query execution times, connection pool usage
- **API Metrics**: Response times, error rates, throughput per endpoint

This architecture provides a solid foundation that can scale efficiently through multiple growth phases while maintaining excellent user experience.
